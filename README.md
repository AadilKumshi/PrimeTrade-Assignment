# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment
This project analyzes the relationship between **trader behavior** and **market sentiment** using real trading data from Hyperliquid and the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.  
The goal is to uncover how factors such as **volume, profitability, risk-taking, and trading direction** align with or diverge from overall market sentiment.  

By combining **exploratory analysis, statistical validation, and predictive modeling**, this project delivers both **technical insights** and **business-relevant conclusions**.  
The findings not only highlight trading patterns under different sentiment conditions but also provide **strategic signals** that can support smarter decision-making in the Web3 trading space.

##  Data
- Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)
- Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index

##  Objective
Explore the relationship between trader performance and market sentiment. Identify patterns in volume, risk, leverage, and profitability.

##  Findings (Highlights)
- Greed → more trades, larger sizes, but not more profitable.
- Fear → fewer trades, but more stable profitability.
- Large trades cluster in Fear → contrarian behavior.
- ML model shows trade size & PnL predict sentiment with decent accuracy.

##  Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SciPy)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

##  Deliverables
- **Cleaned datasets** → `csv_files/`  
- **Exploratory analysis visuals** → `outputs/` (charts & plots)  
- **Polished Colab notebooks** → code + insights  
- **Final business report (`ds_report.pdf`)** → detailed explanations, insights, and strategic conclusions  
- **GitHub repository** → organized project for review and reproducibility
